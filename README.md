# 404 Keybinding Not Found

If you've ever mashed a keyboard shortcut absent-mindedly while trying to break old habits from lesser IDEs, or after changing a familiar keybinding, this extension is for you. With this extension, all the user needs to do is assign the keybinding to the commands provided in this extension, and an unobtrusive notification gently reminds the user the the keybinding shouldn't be used.

## Features

Contributed commands:

* `404-keybinding-not-found.showNotFoundWarning` - Displays a notification that reads "404 - Keybinding not found!"

## Requirements

VSCode 1.50 or newer - I know that's a lot to ask, but trust me, it's worth it!

## Extension Settings

## Known Issues
